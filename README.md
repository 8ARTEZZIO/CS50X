# CS50X – Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard University)

This repository contains my full solutions and notes from **CS50X**, Harvard’s Introduction to Computer Science.

I completed **CS50P** earlier, and now I’m taking CS50x to strengthen my low-level CS foundation:
- C programming
- memory (stack, heap, pointers)
- algorithms & time complexity
- data structures
- SQL
- web basics (HTML / JS / Flask)

---

## Goals
- Build strong CS fundamentals before starting university  
- Improve my algorithmic thinking  
- Prepare for Computer Science degree at QMUL  
- Strengthen backend engineering foundations  

---

## Structure
Each week has its own folder containing:
- lecture notes
- problem sets (psets)
- labs and practice exercises
