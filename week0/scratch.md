1. **Computer programming** is about taking some input and creating some output - thus solving a problem

From the course:


Using three light bulbs, the following could represent zero:

`0 0 0`

Similarly, the following would represent one:

`0 0 1`

By this logic, we could propose that the following equals two:

`0 1 0`

Extending this logic further, the following represents three:

`0 1 1`

Four would appear as:

`1 0 0`

We could, in fact, using only three light bulbs count as high as seven!

`1 1 1`

As a heuristic, we could imagine that the following values represent each possible place in our binary digit:

`4 2 1`

Computers use ‘base-2’ to count. This can be pictured as follows:

`2^2  2^1  2^0`

`4    2    1
`

2. **Computers** generally use eight bits (also known as a byte) to represent a number.
