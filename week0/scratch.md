# Computer Science

1. **Computer programming** is about taking some input and creating some output - thus solving a problem.

  Using three light bulbs, the following could represent zero:
  
  `0 0 0`
  
  Similarly, the following would represent one:
  
  `0 0 1`
  
  By this logic, we could propose that the following equals two:
  
  `0 1 0`
  
  Extending this logic further, the following represents three:
  
  `0 1 1`
  
  Four would appear as:
  
  `1 0 0`
  
  We could, in fact, using only three light bulbs count as high as seven!
  
  `1 1 1`
  
  As a heuristic, we could imagine that the following values represent each possible place in our binary digit:
  
  `4 2 1`
  
  Computers use ‘base-2’ to count. This can be pictured as follows:
  
  `2^2  2^1  2^0`
  
  `4    2    1
  `

2. **Computers** generally use eight bits (also known as a byte) to represent a number.

# ASCII

1. **Letters** are represented using ones and zeroes.
2. **Mapping** of the message 'HI!' would look as follows:
   `H  I  !`

   `72 73 33`

3. Here is an expandes map os ASCII values:

4. Since binary can only count up to 255 we are limited to the number of characters represented by ASCII.
